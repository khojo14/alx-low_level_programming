The malloc function is used to allocate a certain amount of memory during the execution of a program. It will request a block of memory from the heap.
If the request is granted, the operating system will reserve the requested amount of memory and malloc will return a pointer to the reserved space.
When the amount of memory is not needed anymore, you must return it to the operating system by calling the function free.
